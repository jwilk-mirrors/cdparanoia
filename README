cdparanoia release III alpha 3 README
[March 19, 1998]
Monty <xiphmont@mit.edu>

This CDDA reader distribution ('cdparanoia') reads audio from the
CDROM directly as data, with no analog step between, and writes the
data to a file or pipe as .wav, .aifc or as raw 16 bit linear PCM.

These are installation notes; for lots of other cdparanoia related
information, see:

WARNING: (Danger! Danger!)
==========================

This is a *prerelease* of the new cdparanoia package; due to the huge
pool of hardware out there and the newness of the software, this
package is probably kinda buggy yet.  If you use this prerelease and
have any sort of trouble, PLEASE let me know.  Contact information is
at the end of this file.

Requirements
============

1. A CDDA capable CDROM drive (ATAPI, SCSI, or proprietary)

2. For proprietary drives:
   2a. kernel support for the particular CDROM in use
   
   For ATAPI CDROM drives:
   2b. IDE cdrom (ATAPI) support
	(*or*)
   2c. IDE-SCSI host adaptor emulation 
   2d. SCSI cdrom support (optional)
   2e. kernel support for the generic SCSI interface and proper device 
	(/dev/sg?) files in /dev. Most distributions already have the 
	/dev/sg? files.

   For SCSI CDROM drives:
   2f. SCSI cdrom support (optional)
   2g. kernel support for the generic SCSI interface and proper device 
	(/dev/sg?) files in /dev. Most distributions already have the 
	/dev/sg? files.

3. A Linux 2.0.x or 2.1.x kernel

ATAPI drives may be used either with the native IDE cdrom driver, or
with IDE-SCSI host adaptor emulation.  Both work well, but the SCSI
emulation mode may be able to identify and use unusual drives that
report 'CDDA incapable' in native ATAPI mode.  

Also, although a stock SCSI setup may work, performance will be
better if linux/include/scsi/sg.h defines SG_BIG_BUFF to 65536.

/proc filesystem support is no longer needed, although you'll
certainly want to have it for other packages.  Cdparanoia does not
require threading, IPC or sound card support.

Compiling cdparanoia
==================

To build the cdparanoia utility:

	./configure
	make all
	
This will compile cdparanoia; make install (as root) will install it.

Unlike cdda2wav, cdparanoia is smart enough to find CDROM drives
and the appropriate interfaces automatically; if you have only one
CDROM drive, you'll not need to worry about it.  If your machine has
more than one CDROM drive and cdparanoia finds the wrong one,
you'll need to tell it which device to use on the command line (see
the man page and Troubleshooting below).

To build the cdda_interface.a and cdda_paranoia.a libraries:

	./configure
	make lib

Additional installation notes
=============================

Most Linux setups already have performed the steps described below.
The list is useful for doublechecking. (originally taken from Heiko's 
cdda2wav README)

(for SCSI devices)

  Cdparanoia requires the generic SCSI interface; you'll need
  a kernel with compiled-in or module-supplied sg interface.
  In case of a module, this has to be loaded ('modprobe sg'; 
  usually done in boot time scripts).
  This can be verified with 'cat /proc/devices'. It should
  have a line under Character devices:
  21 sg

  Cdparanoia also uses (but doesn't really require) the kernel SCSI
  cdrom driver, ie, a kernel with compiled-in or module-supplied 
  cdrom support. In case of a module, this has to be loaded 
  ('modprobe sr_mod'; again, usually part of boot up scripts).
  This can be verified with 'cat /proc/devices'. It should
  have a line under Block devices:
  11 sr

  If the modules are properly configured but not currently loaded, 
  cdparanoia will trigger loading during its autoscanning.

  In the /dev directory there have to be these descriptors:
  br--------   1 cduser   user      11,   0 Jan 23  1995 sr0
  br--------   1 cduser   user      11,   1 Mar 24  1993 sr1
  etc...

  and
  crw-------   1 cduser   user      21,   0 Aug 27  1995 sga
  crw-------   1 cduser   user      21,   1 Aug 27  1995 sgb
  crw-------   1 cduser   user      21,   2 Aug 27  1995 sgc
  etc...

  and a link named 'cdrom' to the cdrom drive used.  The link can be
  to the cdrom device *or* the generic device.  The link isn't required,
  but it will speed autodetection.

  Permissions and ownership can be changed at will, of course.
  Here access is permitted only to user 'cduser'.

(for ATAPI and proprietary cdrom devices)

  The kernel must have compiled-in or module-supplied cdrom support.
  In case of a module, this has to be loaded ('modprobe <modulename>';
  this is normally included in the boot-up scripts).
  This can be verified with 'cat /proc/devices'. It should
  have a line under Block devices:
  <major> <name of cdrom driver>

  In the /dev directory there have to be these descriptors:
  br--------   1 cduser   user <major>,   0 Jan 23  1995 <cdrom device 1>
  br--------   1 cduser   user <major>,   1 Mar 24  1993 <cdrom device 2>
  etc...

  a link named 'cdrom' to the cdrom drive used will speed up the
  process of finding the cdrom (cdparanoia checks for the link first)

  These steps are usually performed automatically during the
  installation of Linux.

(for ATAPI cdrom drives using IDE-SCSI host adaptor emulation)

  Overall, the instructions are the same as for normal SCSI drives.
  To cause the CDROM drive to appear as a SCSI device instead of ATAPI,
  the kernel must be compiled *with* SCSI and generic SCSI support, and
  *without* IDE CDROM drive (ATAPI) support.  If native ATAPI support is
  enabled, the kernel will always choose to use the native ATAPI driver.

Missing Features (compared to cdda2wav)
=======================================

Specifically, 'cdparanoia' will not play to sound cards, do MD5
signatures, do rate reduction, or generally make use of the maximum
speed available from a CDROM drive.  If your CDROM drive is *not*
prone to jitter and you don't have scratched discs to worry about,
look into Heiko's original cdda2wav.

Troubleshooting
===============

lots o' stuff on the website.

Contacts
========

The author of the original cdda2wav package is Heiko Eissfeldt; he can
be contacted about cdda2wav at heiko@colossus.escape.de.  Although the
cd interface code in cdparanoia is derived from cdda2wav, this
package is my own fault; don't bother Heiko with bug reports, comments
or questions.

I can be contacted at xiphmont@mit.edu.  The main distribution site
for cdparanoia (and the original Paranoia patches to cdda2wav) is

Happy hunting.  Be nice to copyrights.
